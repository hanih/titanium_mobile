Hey there!

Thank you for the interest in contributing. We'd like to review and possibly merge as soon as possible. For this to happen, please make sure the following is in order:

- [x] Sign the [CLA](https://cla.appcelerator.com) for open source contributions (only required for your first contribution)
- [x] Follow the instructions stated in [Contributing to Titanium](https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Contributing+to+Titanium), including the request to squash commits, include unit tests and use clear commit titles (this will be your legacy!)
- [x] If you are fixing an issue that already has a [JIRA ticket](https://jira.appcelerator.org), include the URL in your PR description
- [x] If you are fixing an issue that has no JIRA ticket, yet, create a [new ticket](https://jira.appcelerator.org/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa) and include the URL in your PR description
- [x] Use a clear title, e.g. prefixing it with the JIRA ticket number and platform (`[ABC-123] iOS: Expose new property`)

That's it, you are good to go! If you have any further questions or problems, feel free to ask us on [Ti.Slack](https://tislack.org).

Code strong! :rocket:
